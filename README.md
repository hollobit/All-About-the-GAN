# All-About-the-GAN

### GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks) are the models that used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework. It was introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014.

### The purpose of this repository is providing the summuraized list of the state-of-the-art works on the field of Generative Adversarial Networks since their introduction in 2014.

It provide a list that merged information from various GAN lists and repositoiries as below:
